# Sallam_Omar-assignment-2

This is a Javascript challenge based on York University's CSFS1010-007-B-F21 React course.

The objective of the assignment is to modify a HTML statrup file with javascript to:
1. Accept input from a user after pressing "enter"
2. That input will be taken as a value and added to an unordered list under the input field
3. The list item can be chosen and clicked "done" indicating so.
